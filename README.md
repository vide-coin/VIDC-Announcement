# About VIDC
VIDC has built the world's first invisible embed layer that rests silently atop any website in the world, powered by the Ethereum blockchain.
VIDC's patent-pending invention allows publishers to embed a tiny video into the text of their site, letting their users hold down on that linked text to reveal supporting video for literally anything that is printed online. The user never leaves the page.
VIDC constructs a ledger system that measures how long a user watches an ad thanks to hold tracking technology on its embed layer. VIDC then rewards publishers and users accordingly for holding down on ads with VIDC Coins, taken as a fraction of the VIDCCoin payout made from advertiser to publisher for that video ad impression.

Since then VIDC has amassed a world-class engineering team of 15 people based in San Francisco, with team members who have previously sold their own companies, amassed 10s of millions of users, patented multi-million dollar inventions, and have enjoyed decades of successes in the software development world.
